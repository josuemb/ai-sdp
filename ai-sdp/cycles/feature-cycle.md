# Feature Development Cycle

## Purpose
Develop individual features through structured sub-cycles: planning, implementation, testing, and deployment.

## Sub-Cycles
1. **Feature Planning** - Define scope, break down tasks, estimate effort
2. **Implementation** - Code development with testing and documentation
3. **Testing & QA** - Comprehensive testing and quality assurance with mandatory coverage validation
4. **Deployment & Feedback** - Deploy and gather user feedback

**MANDATORY TESTING DECISIONS**: First feature cycle must complete testing decisions from `cycles/2.3-testing-decisions.md`

## Context Requirements
- Read requirements.md and decisions-log.md before starting
- Update project-status.md throughout cycle
- Create TODO lists for each sub-cycle

## Detailed Instructions
For complete sub-cycle processes and templates: Load `details/cycle-details/feature-cycle.md`
