# Development Setup & Project Structure

## Purpose
Configure development environment through mandatory sub-cycles: testing framework, code quality tools, and security practices.

## MANDATORY Sub-Cycle Sequence
**CRITICAL**: Must complete ALL sub-cycles in order:
1. **1.3.1 Testing Framework** → `cycles/1.3.1-testing-framework-decision.md`
2. **1.3.2 Code Quality Tools** → `cycles/1.3.2-code-quality-decisions.md`  
3. **1.3.3 Security Best Practices** → `cycles/1.3.3-security-best-practices-decision.md`

## Sub-Cycle Enforcement
- Cannot skip any sub-cycle
- Must complete in sequential order
- State file tracks completion status
- Only proceed to Feature Cycles after ALL sub-cycles complete

## Detailed Instructions
For complete sub-cycle validation and enforcement logic: Load `details/cycle-details/development-setup-detailed.md`
