# Testing Framework Decisions (Feature Cycle Sub-cycle 2.3/3.3/4.3)

## Purpose
Make critical testing decisions for feature implementation using AI decision framework.

## MANDATORY Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Test Coverage Threshold
**Context**: Determine minimum test coverage percentage for feature deployment
**Process**: Use `framework/decision-framework.md` to:
- Research industry standards for test coverage thresholds
- Present options (e.g., 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%)
- Consider project complexity and risk tolerance
- **WAIT for developer selection**

### Decision 2: Coverage Measurement Tools
**Context**: Select tools for measuring and reporting test coverage
**Process**: Use `framework/decision-framework.md` to:
- Research current coverage tools for chosen technology stack
- Present options with pros/cons and integration complexity
- Consider CI/CD pipeline compatibility
- **WAIT for developer selection**

### Decision 3: Test Types Priority
**Context**: Determine emphasis on unit vs integration vs e2e tests
**Process**: Use `framework/decision-framework.md` to:
- Research testing pyramid best practices
- Present options for test distribution strategies
- Consider feature complexity and user impact
- **WAIT for developer selection**

## Implementation Requirements
After decisions are made:
- Configure coverage tools with selected threshold
- Set up automated coverage reporting
- Integrate coverage validation into CI/CD pipeline
- Document testing standards in decisions-log.md

## Validation
- Coverage threshold enforced automatically
- Tests must pass before deployment
- Coverage reports generated for each feature
- Testing decisions logged for future reference
