# Requirements Specification Method Decision

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP

Before any requirements analysis, you MUST research and present requirements specification method options.

## EXACT RESEARCH QUERIES TO USE

**CRITICAL**: Before conducting web research, get current year using: `date +%Y`

Use these EXACT web search queries (replace {CURRENT_YEAR} with result from date command):

1. "software requirements specification methods User Stories BDD Use Cases {CURRENT_YEAR}"
2. "formal requirements documentation techniques structured analysis"
3. "BDD Behavior Driven Development vs User Stories vs Use Cases pros cons"
4. "requirements gathering methodologies formal vs informal approaches"
5. "software requirements analysis techniques structured methods {CURRENT_YEAR}"

## EXPECTED OPTIONS TO FIND

Your research should discover and present these types of methods:

**Formal Methods:**
- User Stories
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
- Use Cases
- Structured Analysis
- Formal Requirements Specification

**Informal Methods:**
- Simple text documentation
- Bullet point lists
- Conversational requirements
- Lightweight documentation

## DECISION FRAMEWORK FORMAT

Present 5-6 options using `framework/decision-framework.md` format:
- Option name and description from research
- Pros/cons discovered through research
- Use cases and contexts from research sources
- Research sources (name - URL)
- Mark ONE as RECOMMENDED based on research and project context

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

- Wait for developer to choose ONE method before proceeding
- Log decision in decisions-log.md with research sources
- Only then proceed to requirements gathering using chosen method
