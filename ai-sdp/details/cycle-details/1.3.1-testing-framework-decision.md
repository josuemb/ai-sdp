# Testing Framework Decision (Cycle 1.3.1)

## MANDATORY: AI Decision Framework Process

**CRITICAL**: This decision MUST use the complete `framework/decision-framework.md` process:

1. **Web Research**: Use web_search tool to research current testing frameworks
2. **Options Analysis**: Present 3-5 testing framework options with comprehensive analysis
3. **Recommendation**: Mark ONE option as RECOMMENDED with clear rationale
4. **Decision Logging**: Log in decisions-log.md with complete sources and reasoning
5. **Git Commit**: Create commit after decision is made

## Decision Context

**Prerequisites**: 
- Technology stack selected (language/framework)
- Architecture decisions completed
- Development environment chosen

**Decision Scope**: Select primary testing framework for the project

## Research Areas

### 1. **Unit Testing Frameworks**
**Research using web_search tool**:
- **FIRST**: Execute `date +%Y` to get current year
- Current popular unit testing frameworks for chosen language (include current year in search)
- Performance benchmarks and feature comparisons (current year)
- Community adoption and maintenance status (current year)
- Integration with chosen development stack

### 2. **Integration Testing Capabilities**
**Research using web_search tool**:
- Database testing support (current year best practices)
- API testing capabilities (current year tools)
- Mock/stub functionality (current year approaches)
- Test isolation and cleanup (current year methods)

### 3. **End-to-End Testing Options**
**Research using web_search tool**:
- Browser automation capabilities (current year tools)
- Cross-platform support (current year standards)
- CI/CD integration (current year best practices)
- Debugging and reporting features (current year innovations)

### 4. **Developer Experience**
**Research using web_search tool**:
- Setup complexity and learning curve (current year reviews)
- IDE integration and debugging support (current year tools)
- Test writing syntax and readability (current year standards)
- Error reporting and diagnostics (current year improvements)

## Decision Framework Application

### Step 1: Context Research
- **Current Project**: [Technology stack from previous decisions]
- **Team Size**: [From requirements analysis]
- **Testing Requirements**: [From architecture decisions]
- **CI/CD Needs**: [From development workflow decisions]

### Step 2: Generate Options (3-5 frameworks)
**For each framework, provide**:
- **Framework Name**: Clear identification
- **Rationale**: Why it fits the project context
- **Pros**: Key advantages and strengths
- **Cons**: Limitations and trade-offs
- **Best For**: Ideal use cases
- **Source**: Research reference with complete URL

### Step 3: Recommendation
**MANDATORY FORMAT**:
```
Based on research, here are your testing framework options:

1. **[Framework A]** - [description]
   - Pros: [advantages]
   - Cons: [disadvantages]
   - Source: [Reference - URL]

2. **[Framework B]** - [description]
   - Pros: [advantages]
   - Cons: [disadvantages]
   - Source: [Reference - URL]

⭐ **RECOMMENDED**: Option [X] because [reasoning]

Which testing framework do you choose? (1, 2, 3, etc.)
```

**CRITICAL**: WAIT for developer response before proceeding to Step 4.

### Step 4: Decision Logging
**CRITICAL VALIDATION**: Only proceed to logging AFTER developer has explicitly chosen an option by number.

**Log in decisions-log.md**:
- **Date**: Decision timestamp
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Why testing framework selection was needed
- **Decision**: Selected framework with version
- **Consequences**: Expected impact on development workflow
- **Alternatives**: Other frameworks considered
- **Research Sources**: Complete URLs from web_search tool research

### Step 5: Implementation Planning
**After decision, create**:
- Testing strategy document
- Sample test file structure
- CI/CD integration plan
- Team onboarding guide

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Testing Framework Decision**: Logged in decisions-log.md
2. **Testing Strategy**: Document outlining testing approach
3. **Sample Tests**: Example unit, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Configuration Files**: Framework setup and configuration
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing pipeline setup
6. **Git Commit**: Conventional commit with testing framework selection

## Integration with Development Setup

This decision feeds into:
- **Project Structure**: Test directory organization
- **Build System**: Test script configuration
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing setup
- **Development Workflow**: Test-driven development practices

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Testing framework selected using AI decision framework
- ✅ Decision properly logged with research sources
- ✅ Sample tests created for chosen framework
- ✅ CI/CD integration configured
- ✅ Team documentation provided
- ✅ Git commit created with conventional format
